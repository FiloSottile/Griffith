UNIX systems
============

1.1 Installing on some Linux distributions

	1.1.1 Debian GNU/Linux and Ubuntu

		Griffith is available in official repositories,
		all you have to do is execute:

			# aptitude install griffith
	
	1.1.2 Arch Linux
		
		Download PKGBUILD file from:
			http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?K=griffith
		and follow this guide:
			http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/New_AUR_user_guidelines

	1.1.3 Gentoo Linux

		# emerge -a griffith

1.1 Installing from source

	Unpack the Griffith tarball using these commands:

		$ tar -zxf griffith-<version>.tar.gz

	Switch to the newly created directory and type as root:
	
		# make install

	The Makefile will copy the files to the correct location in your
	system. You do not need to configure or compile Griffith as it is
	written in interpreted Python code.

	You can test Griffith without installing it:

		$ cd griffith-version
		$ ./griffith

1.2 Installing from downloaded package

	If you have downloaded Griffith package, just do as root:

	* deb packages (Debian, Ubuntu, ...)

		# dpkg -i griffith_<version>_all.deb

	* rpm packages (Redhat, Fedora, Mandrake, ...)

		# rpm -Uvh griffith_<version>.rpm

1.3 Making Debian package

	If you want to make your own Debian package, follow these steps:
	* change your working directory to griffith source
	* edit debian/changelog file, f.e. like this:
		$ dch -v <version> -D UNRELEASED -i NOT RELEASED YET
	* type `debuild` or `dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot` to build package
	* install new package (`dpkg -i ../griffith_<version>_all.deb`)

Microsoft Windows systems
=========================

Just run the griffith installer available for your system.
A separated GTK+ Runtime Environment for Win32 is NOT necessary.
For now, Griffith is only known to work under Microsoft Windows XP
Professional Edition but should work on other windows flavours too.
