UNIX systems
============

1.1 Installing from source

	Unpack the Griffith tarball using these commands:

	'tar -zxfv <package_name>.tar.gz'

	Switch to the newly created directory and type 'make install' as root
	(or 'sudo make install'	if you are using sudo, for example when using
	Ubuntu Linux) and the Makefile will copy the files to the correct location
	in your system. You do not need to configure or compile Griffith as it is
	written in interpreted Python code.

1.2 Installing from downloaded package

	If you have downloaded Griffith package, just do as root:
	
	- deb packages (Debian, Ubuntu, ...)

		`dpkg -i <package_name>`
	
	- rpm packages (Redhat, Fedora, Mandrake, ...)

		`rpm -Uvh <package name>`

1.3 Installing from Debian repository

	For stable packages, add in your /etc/apt/sources.list:
	
		deb http://griffith.vasconunes.net/debian/ stable main

	For unstable packages, add in your /etc/apt/sources.list:
	
		deb http://griffith.vasconunes.net/debian/ unstable main

	Run as root:

		`aptitude update && aptitude install griffith`
	or
		`apt-get update && apt-get install griffith`

	All packages are signed with Piotr Ozarowski's GPG key.
	You can import it with the following command (as root):
		
		`gpg --keyserver subkeys.pgp.net --recv-keys ED75F599`
		`gpg --armor --export ED75F599 | apt-key add -`

1.4 Making Debian package

	If you want to make your own Debian package, follow these steps:
	- change your working directory to griffith source
	- edit debian/changelog file
	- type `dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot`
	- install new package

Microsoft Windows systems
=========================

Just run the griffith installer available for your system.
A separated GTK+ Runtime Environment for Win32 is NOT necessary.
For now, Griffith is only known to work under Microsoft Windows XP Professional Edition but should work on other windows flavours too.
