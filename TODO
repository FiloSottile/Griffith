* Nice PDF tabular report
* Export to SQL, text
* Movie number edition
* Possibility to search different fields from different sites (plugins)
* Searching movies by director or another field
* More powerfull command line interface
* Possibility to use external database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, ...)
* Advanced sort/filter criteria
* Customising main list view
* Probably much more than this :-D
